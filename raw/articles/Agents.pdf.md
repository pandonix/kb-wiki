Introduction
Humans are fantastic at messy pattern recognition tasks. However, they often rely on tools 
- like books, Google Search, or a calculator - to supplement their prior knowledge before 
arriving at a conclusion. Just like humans, Generative AI models can be trained to use tools 
to access real-time information or suggest a real-world action. For example, a model can 
leverage a database retrieval tool to access specific information, like a customer's purchase 
history, so it can generate tailored shopping recommendations. Alternatively, based on a 
user's query, a model can make various API calls to send an email response to a colleague 
or complete a financial transaction on your behalf. To do so, the model must not only have 
access to a set of external tools, it needs the ability to plan and execute any task in a self-
directed fashion. This combination of reasoning, logic, and access to external information 
that are all connected to a Generative AI model invokes the concept of an agent, or a 
program that extends beyond the standalone capabilities of a Generative AI model. This 
whitepaper dives into all these and associated aspects in more detail.
This combination of reasoning, 
logic, and access to external 
information that are all connected 
to a Generative AI model invokes 
the concept of an agent.

What is an agent?
In its most fundamental form, a Generative AI agent can be defined as an application that 
attempts to achieve a goal by observing the world and acting upon it using the tools that it 
has at its disposal. Agents are autonomous and can act independently of human intervention, 
especially when provided with proper goals or objectives they are meant to achieve. Agents 
can also be proactive in their approach to reaching their goals. Even in the absence of 
explicit instruction sets from a human, an agent can reason about what it should do next to 
achieve its ultimate goal. While the notion of agents in AI is quite general and powerful, this 
whitepaper focuses on the specific types of agents that Generative AI models are capable of 
building at the time of publication.
In order to understand the inner workings of an agent, let’s first introduce the foundational 
components that drive the agent’s behavior, actions, and decision making. The combination 
of these components can be described as a cognitive architecture, and there are many 
such architectures that can be achieved by the mixing and matching of these components. 
Focusing on the core functionalities, there are three essential components in an agent’s 
cognitive architecture as shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1. General agent architecture and components
The model
In the scope of an agent, a model refers to the language model (LM) that will be utilized as 
the centralized decision maker for agent processes. The model used by an agent can be one 
or multiple LM’s of any size (small / large) that are capable of following instruction based 
reasoning and logic frameworks, like ReAct, Chain-of-Thought, or Tree-of-Thoughts. Models 
can be general purpose, multimodal or fine-tuned based on the needs of your specific agent 
architecture. For best production results, you should leverage a model that best fits your 
desired end application and, ideally, has been trained on data signatures associated with the 
tools that you plan to use in the cognitive architecture. It’s important to note that the model is 
typically not trained with the specific configuration settings (i.e. tool choices, orchestration/
reasoning setup) of the agent. However, it’s possible to further refine the model for the 
agent’s tasks by providing it with examples that showcase the agent’s capabilities, including 
instances of the agent using specific tools or reasoning steps in various contexts.

The tools
Foundational models, despite their impressive text and image generation, remain constrained 
by their inability to interact with the outside world. Tools bridge this gap, empowering agents 
to interact with external data and services while unlocking a wider range of actions beyond 
that of the underlying model alone. Tools can take a variety of forms and have varying 
depths of complexity, but typically align with common web API methods like GET, POST, 
PATCH, and DELETE. For example, a tool could update customer information in a database 
or fetch weather data to influence a travel recommendation that the agent is providing to 
the user. With tools, agents can access and process real-world information. This empowers 
them to support more specialized systems like retrieval augmented generation (RAG), 
which significantly extends an agent’s capabilities beyond what the foundational model can 
achieve on its own. We’ll discuss tools in more detail below, but the most important thing 
to understand is that tools bridge the gap between the agent’s internal capabilities and the 
external world, unlocking a broader range of possibilities.
The orchestration layer
The orchestration layer describes a cyclical process that governs how the agent takes in 
information, performs some internal reasoning, and uses that reasoning to inform its next 
action or decision. In general, this loop will continue until an agent has reached its goal or a 
stopping point. The complexity of the orchestration layer can vary greatly depending on the 
agent and task it’s performing. Some loops can be simple calculations with decision rules, 
while others may contain chained logic, involve additional machine learning algorithms, or 
implement other probabilistic reasoning techniques. We’ll discuss more about the detailed 
implementation of the agent orchestration layers in the cognitive architecture section.

Agents vs. models
To gain a clearer understanding of the distinction between agents and models, consider the 
following chart:
Models Agents
Knowledge is limited to what is available in their 
training data.
Knowledge is extended through the connection 
with external systems via tools
Single inference / prediction based on the 
user query. Unless explicitly implemented for 
the model, there is no management of session 
history or continuous context. (i.e. chat history)
Managed session history (i.e. chat history) to 
allow for multi turn inference / prediction based 
on user queries and decisions made in the 
orchestration layer. In this context, a ‘turn’ is 
defined as an interaction between the interacting 
system and the agent. (i.e. 1 incoming event/
query and 1 agent response)
No native tool implementation. Tools are natively implemented in agent 
architecture.
No native logic layer implemented. Users can 
form prompts as simple questions or use 
reasoning frameworks (CoT, ReAct, etc.) to 
form complex prompts to guide the model in 
prediction.
Native cognitive architecture that uses reasoning 
frameworks like CoT, ReAct, or other pre-built 
agent frameworks like LangChain.
Cognitive architectures: How agents operate 
Imagine a chef in a busy kitchen. Their goal is to create delicious dishes for restaurant 
patrons which involves some cycle of planning, execution, and adjustment. 

---

• They gather information, like the patron’s order and what ingredients are in the pantry 
and refrigerator.
• They perform some internal reasoning about what dishes and flavor profiles they can 
create based on the information they have just gathered.
• They take action to create the dish: chopping vegetables, blending spices, searing meat.
At each stage in the process the chef makes adjustments as needed, refining their plan as 
ingredients are depleted or customer feedback is received, and uses the set of previous 
outcomes to determine the next plan of action. This cycle of information intake, planning, 
executing, and adjusting describes a unique cognitive architecture that the chef employs to 
reach their goal.
Just like the chef, agents can use cognitive architectures to reach their end goals by 
iteratively processing information, making informed decisions, and refining next actions 
based on previous outputs. At the core of agent cognitive architectures lies the orchestration 
layer, responsible for maintaining memory, state, reasoning and planning. It uses the rapidly 
evolving field of prompt engineering and associated frameworks to guide reasoning and 
planning, enabling the agent to interact more effectively with its environment and complete 
tasks. Research in the area of prompt engineering frameworks and task planning for 
language models is rapidly evolving, yielding a variety of promising approaches. While not an 
exhaustive list, these are a few of the most popular frameworks and reasoning techniques 
available at the time of this publication:
• ReAct, a prompt engineering framework that provides a thought process strategy for 
language models to Reason and take action on a user query, with or without in-context 
examples. ReAct prompting has shown to outperform several SOTA baselines and improve 
human interoperability and trustworthiness of LLMs.

• Chain-of-Thought (CoT), a prompt engineering framework that enables reasoning 
capabilities through intermediate steps. There are various sub-techniques of CoT including 
self-consistency, active-prompt, and multimodal CoT that each have strengths and 
weaknesses depending on the specific application.
• Tree-of-thoughts (ToT),, a prompt engineering framework that is well suited for 
exploration or strategic lookahead tasks. It generalizes over chain-of-thought prompting 
and allows the model to explore various thought chains that serve as intermediate steps 
for general problem solving with language models.
Agents can utilize one of the above reasoning techniques, or many other techniques, to 
choose the next best action for the given user request. For example, let’s consider an agent 
that is programmed to use the ReAct framework to choose the correct actions and tools for 
the user query. The sequence of events might go something like this:
1. User sends query to the agent
2. Agent begins the ReAct sequence
3. The agent provides a prompt to the model, asking it to generate one of the next ReAct 
steps and its corresponding output:
a. Question: The input question from the user query, provided with the prompt
b. Thought: The model’s thoughts about what it should do next
c. Action: The model’s decision on what action to take next
i. This is where tool choice can occur
ii. For example, an action could be one of [Flights, Search, Code, None], where the first 
3 represent a known tool that the model can choose, and the last represents “no 
tool choice”

d. Action input: The model’s decision on what inputs to provide to the tool (if any)
e. Observation: The result of the action / action input sequence
i. This thought / action / action input / observation could repeat N-times as needed
f. Final answer: The model’s final answer to provide to the original user query
4. The ReAct loop concludes and a final answer is provided back to the user
Figure 2. Example agent with ReAct reasoning in the orchestration layer
As shown in Figure 2, the model, tools, and agent configuration work together to provide 
a grounded, concise response back to the user based on the user’s original query. While 
the model could have guessed at an answer (hallucinated) based on its prior knowledge, 
it instead used a tool (Flights) to search for real-time external information. This additional 
information was provided to the model, allowing it to make a more informed decision based 
on real factual data and to summarize this information back to the user.

In summary, the quality of agent responses can be tied directly to the model’s ability to 
reason and act about these various tasks, including the ability to select the right tools, and 
how well that tools has been defined. Like a chef crafting a dish with fresh ingredients and 
attentive to customer feedback, agents rely on sound reasoning and reliable information to 
deliver optimal results. In the next section, we’ll dive into the various ways agents connect 
with fresh data. 
Tools: Our keys to the outside world
While language models excel at processing information, they lack the ability to directly 
perceive and influence the real world. This limits their usefulness in situations requiring 
interaction with external systems or data. This means that, in a sense, a language model 
is only as good as what it has learned from its training data. But regardless of how much 
data we throw at a model, they still lack the fundamental ability to interact with the outside 
world. So how can we empower our models to have real-time, context-aware interaction with 
external systems? Functions, Extensions, Data Stores and Plugins are all ways to provide this 
critical capability to the model.
While they go by many names, tools are what create a link between our foundational models 
and the outside world. This link to external systems and data allows our agent to perform a 
wider variety of tasks and do so with more accuracy and reliability. For instance, tools can 
enable agents to adjust smart home settings, update calendars, fetch user information from 
a database, or send emails based on a specific set of instructions.
As of the date of this publication, there are three primary tool types that Google models are 
able to interact with: Extensions, Functions, and Data Stores. By equipping agents with tools, 
we unlock a vast potential for them to not only understand the world but also act upon it, 
opening doors to a myriad of new applications and possibilities.

Extensions 
The easiest way to understand Extensions is to think of them as bridging the gap between 
an API and an agent in a standardized way, allowing agents to seamlessly execute APIs 
regardless of their underlying implementation. Let’s say that you’ve built an agent with a goal 
of helping users book flights. You know that you want to use the Google Flights API to retrieve 
flight information, but you’re not sure how you’re going to get your agent to make calls to this 
API endpoint.
Figure 3. How do Agents interact with External APIs?
One approach could be to implement custom code that would take the incoming user query, 
parse the query for relevant information, then make the API call. For example, in a flight 
booking use case a user might state “I want to book a flight from Austin to Zurich.” In this 
scenario, our custom code solution would need to extract “Austin” and “Zurich” as relevant 
entities from the user query before attempting to make the API call. But what happens if the 
user says “I want to book a flight to Zurich” and never provides a departure city? The API call 
would fail without the required data and more code would need to be implemented in order 
to catch edge and corner cases like this. This approach is not scalable and could easily break 
in any scenario that falls outside of the implemented custom code.

A more resilient approach would be to use an Extension. An Extension bridges the gap 
between an agent and an API by:
1. Teaching the agent how to use the API endpoint using examples.
2. Teaching the agent what arguments or parameters are needed to successfully call the 
API endpoint.
Figure 4. Extensions connect Agents to External APIs
Extensions can be crafted independently of the agent, but should be provided as part of the 
agent’s configuration. The agent uses the model and examples at run time to decide which 
Extension, if any, would be suitable for solving the user’s query. This highlights a key strength 
of Extensions, their built-in example types, that allow the agent to dynamically select the 
most appropriate Extension for the task.

Think of this the same way that a software developer decides which API endpoints to use 
while solving and solutioning for a user’s problem. If the user wants to book a flight, the 
developer might use the Google Flights API. If the user wants to know where the nearest 
coffee shop is relative to their location, the developer might use the Google Maps API. In 
this same way, the agent / model stack uses a set of known Extensions to decide which one 
will be the best fit for the user’s query. If you’d like to see Extensions in action, you can try 
them out on the Gemini application by going to Settings > Extensions and then enabling any 
you would like to test. For example, you could enable the Google Flights extension then ask 
Gemini “Show me flights from Austin to Zurich leaving next Friday.”
Sample Extensions 
To simplify the usage of Extensions, Google provides some out of the box extensions that 
can be quickly imported into your project and used with minimal configurations. For example, 
the Code Interpreter extension in Snippet 1 allows you to generate and run Python code from 
a natural language description.

To summarize, Extensions provide a way for agents to perceive, interact, and influence the 
outside world in a myriad of ways. The selection and invocation of these Extensions is guided 
by the use of Examples, all of which are defined as part of the Extension configuration.
Functions 
In the world of software engineering, functions are defined as self-contained modules 
of code that accomplish a specific task and can be reused as needed. When a software 
developer is writing a program, they will often create many functions to do various tasks. 
They will also define the logic for when to call function_a versus function_b, as well as the 
expected inputs and outputs.
Functions work very similarly in the world of agents, but we can replace the software 
developer with a model. A model can take a set of known functions and decide when to use 
each Function and what arguments the Function needs based on its specification. Functions 
differ from Extensions in a few ways, most notably:
1. A model outputs a Function and its arguments, but doesn’t make a live API call.
2. Functions are executed on the client-side, while Extensions are executed on 
the agent-side.
Using our Google Flights example again, a simple setup for functions might look like the 
example in Figure 7.

---

### Page 19

Figure 7. How do functions interact with external APIs?
Note that the main difference here is that neither the Function nor the agent interact directly 
with the Google Flights API. So how does the API call actually happen?
With functions, the logic and execution of calling the actual API endpoint is offloaded away 
from the agent and back to the client-side application as seen in Figure 8 and Figure 9 below. 
This offers the developer more granular control over the flow of data in the application. There 
are many reasons why a Developer might choose to use functions over Extensions, but a few 
common use cases are:
• API calls need to be made at another layer of the application stack, outside of the direct 
agent architecture flow (e.g. a middleware system, a front end framework, etc.)
• Security or Authentication restrictions that prevent the agent from calling an API directly 
(e.g API is not exposed to the internet, or non-accessible by agent infrastructure)
• Timing or order-of-operations constraints that prevent the agent from making API calls in 
real-time. (i.e. batch operations, human-in-the-loop review, etc.)

---

### Page 20

Agents

• Additional data transformation logic needs to be applied to the API Response that the 
agent cannot perform. For example, consider an API endpoint that doesn’t provide a 
filtering mechanism for limiting the number of results returned. Using Functions on the 
client-side provides the developer additional opportunities to make these transformations. 
• The developer wants to iterate on agent development without deploying additional 
infrastructure for the API endpoints (i.e. Function Calling can act like “stubbing” of APIs)
While the difference in internal architecture between the two approaches is subtle as seen in 
Figure 8, the additional control and decoupled dependency on external infrastructure makes 
Function Calling an appealing option for the Developer.

Use cases
A model can be used to invoke functions in order to handle complex, client-side execution 
flows for the end user, where the agent Developer might not want the language model to 
manage the API execution (as is the case with Extensions). Let’s consider the following 
example where an agent is being trained as a travel concierge to interact with users that want 
to book vacation trips. The goal is to get the agent to produce a list of cities that we can use 
in our middleware application to download images, data, etc. for the user’s trip planning. A 
user might say something like:
I’d like to take a ski trip with my family but I’m not sure where to go.
In a typical prompt to the model, the output might look like the following:
Sure, here’s a list of cities that you can consider for family ski trips:
• Crested Butte, Colorado, USA
• Whistler, BC, Canada
• Zermatt, Switzerland
While the above output contains the data that we need (city names), the format isn’t ideal 
for parsing. With Function Calling, we can teach a model to format this output in a structured 
style (like JSON) that’s more convenient for another system to parse. Given the same input 
prompt from the user, an example JSON output from a Function might look like Snippet 
5 instead.

    }
}
Snippet 5. Sample Function Call payload for displaying a list of cities and user preferences
This JSON payload is generated by the model, and then sent to our Client-side server to do 
whatever we would like to do with it. In this specific case, we’ll call the Google Places API to 
take the cities provided by the model and look up Images, then provide them as formatted 
rich content back to our User. Consider this sequence diagram in Figure 9 showing the above 
interaction in step by step detail.

---

### Page 23

Figure 9. Sequence diagram showing the lifecycle of a Function Call
The result of the example in Figure 9 is that the model is leveraged to “fill in the blanks” with 
the parameters required for the Client side UI to make the call to the Google Places API. The 
Client side UI manages the actual API call using the parameters provided by the model in the 
returned Function. This is just one use case for Function Calling, but there are many other 
scenarios to consider like:
• You want a language model to suggest a function that you can use in your code, but you 
don't want to include credentials in your code. Because function calling doesn't run the 
function, you don't need to include credentials in your code with the function information.

---

### Page 24

• You are running asynchronous operations that can take more than a few seconds. These 
scenarios work well with function calling because it's an asynchronous operation.
• You want to run functions on a device that's different from the system producing the 
function calls and their arguments.
One key thing to remember about functions is that they are meant to offer the developer 
much more control over not only the execution of API calls, but also the entire flow of data 
in the application as a whole. In the example in Figure 9, the developer chose to not return 
API information back to the agent as it was not pertinent for future actions the agent might 
take. However, based on the architecture of the application, it may make sense to return the 
external API call data to the agent in order to influence future reasoning, logic, and action 
choices. Ultimately, it is up to the application developer to choose what is right for the 
specific application.
Function sample code
To achieve the above output from our ski vacation scenario, let’s build out each of the 
components to make this work with our gemini-1.5-flash-001 model. 
First, we’ll define our display_cities function as a simple Python method.

Snippet 7. Building a Tool, sending to the model with a user query and allowing the function call to take place
In summary, functions offer a straightforward framework that empowers application 
developers with fine-grained control over data flow and system execution, while effectively 
leveraging the agent/model for critical input generation. Developers can selectively choose 
whether to keep the agent “in the loop” by returning external data, or omit it based on 
specific application architecture requirements.

Data stores
Imagine a language model as a vast library of books, containing its training data. But unlike 
a library that continuously acquires new volumes, this one remains static, holding only the 
knowledge it was initially trained on. This presents a challenge, as real-world knowledge is 
constantly evolving. Data Stores address this limitation by providing access to more dynamic 
and up-to-date information, and ensuring a model’s responses remain grounded in factuality 
and relevance.
Consider a common scenario where a developer might need to provide a small amount of 
additional data to a model, perhaps in the form of spreadsheets or PDFs.

Data Stores allow developers to provide additional data in its original format to an agent, 
eliminating the need for time-consuming data transformations, model retraining, or fine-
tuning. The Data Store converts the incoming document into a set of vector database 
embeddings that the agent can use to extract the information it needs to supplement its next 
action or response to the user.
Figure 11. Data Stores connect Agents to new real-time data sources of various types.
Implementation and application
In the context of Generative AI agents, Data Stores are typically implemented as a vector 
database that the developer wants the agent to have access to at runtime. While we won’t 
cover vector databases in depth here, the key point to understand is that they store data 
in the form of vector embeddings, a type of high-dimensional vector or mathematical 
representation of the data provided. One of the most prolific examples of Data Store usage 
with language models in recent times has been the implementation of Retrieval Augmented

Generation (RAG) based applications. These applications seek to extend the breadth and 
depth of a model’s knowledge beyond the foundational training data by giving the model 
access to data in various formats like:
• Website content
• Structured Data in formats like PDF, Word Docs, CSV, Spreadsheets, etc.
• Unstructured Data in formats like HTML, PDF, TXT, etc.
Figure 12. 1-to-many relationship between agents and data stores, which can represent various types of 
pre-indexed data
The underlying process for each user request and agent response loop is generally modeled 
as seen in Figure 13.
1. A user query is sent to an embedding model to generate embeddings for the query
2. The query embeddings are then matched against the contents of the vector database 
using a matching algorithm like SCaNN
3. The matched content is retrieved from the vector database in text format and sent back to 
the agent
4. The agent receives both the user query and retrieved content, then formulates a response 
or action

Figure 13. The lifecycle of a user request and agent response in a RAG based application
The end result is an application that allows the agent to match a user’s query to a known data 
store through vector search, retrieve the original content, and provide it to the orchestration 
layer and model for further processing. The next action might be to provide a final answer to 
the user, or perform an additional vector search to further refine the results.
A sample interaction with an agent that implements RAG with ReAct reasoning/planning can 
be seen in Figure 14.

Tools recap
To summarize, extensions, functions and data stores make up a few different tool types 
available for agents to use at runtime. Each has their own purpose and they can be used 
together or independently at the discretion of the agent developer. 
Extensions Function Calling Data Stores
Execution Agent-Side Execution Client-Side Execution Agent-Side Execution
Use Case • Developer wants 
agent to control 
interactions with the 
API endpoints
• Useful when 
leveraging native pre-
built Extensions (i.e. 
Vertex Search, Code 
Interpreter, etc.)
• Multi-hop planning 
and API calling 
(i.e. the next agent 
action depends on 
the outputs of the 
previous action / 
API call)
• Security or 
Authentication 
restrictions prevent the 
agent from calling an 
API directly
• Timing constraints or 
order-of-operations 
constraints that 
prevent the agent 
from making API calls 
in real-time. (i.e. batch 
operations, human-in-
the-loop review, etc.)
• API that is not exposed 
to the internet, or 
non-accessible by 
Google systems
Developer wants to 
implement Retrieval 
Augmented Generation 
(RAG) with any of the 
following data types:
• Website Content from 
pre-indexed domains 
and URLs
• Structured Data in 
formats like PDF, 
Word Docs, CSV, 
Spreadsheets, etc.
• Relational / Non- 
Relational Databases
• Unstructured Data in 
formats like HTML, PDF, 
TXT, etc.

Enhancing model performance with 
targeted learning
A crucial aspect of using models effectively is their ability to choose the right tools when 
generating output, especially when using tools at scale in production. While general training 
helps models develop this skill, real-world scenarios often require knowledge beyond the 
training data. Imagine this as the difference between basic cooking skills and mastering 
a specific cuisine. Both require foundational cooking knowledge, but the latter demands 
targeted learning for more nuanced results.
To help the model gain access to this type of specific knowledge, several approaches exist:
• In-context learning: This method provides a generalized model with a prompt, tools, and 
few-shot examples at inference time which allows it to learn ‘on the fly' how and when to 
use those tools for a specific task. The ReAct framework is an example of this approach in 
natural language.
• Retrieval-based in-context learning: This technique dynamically populates the model 
prompt with the most relevant information, tools, and associated examples by retrieving 
them from external memory. An example of this would be the ‘Example Store’ in Vertex AI 
extensions or the data stores RAG based architecture mentioned previously.
• Fine-tuning based learning: This method involves training a model using a larger dataset 
of specific examples prior to inference. This helps the model understand when and how to 
apply certain tools prior to receiving any user queries. 
To provide additional insights on each of the targeted learning approaches, let’s revisit our 
cooking analogy.

• Imagine a chef has received a specific recipe (the prompt), a few key ingredients (relevant 
tools) and some example dishes (few-shot examples) from a customer. Based on this 
limited information and the chef’s general knowledge of cooking, they will need to figure 
out how to prepare the dish ‘on the fly’ that most closely aligns with the recipe and the 
customer’s preferences. This is in-context learning.
• Now let’s imagine our chef in a kitchen that has a well-stocked pantry (external data 
stores) filled with various ingredients and cookbooks (examples and tools). The chef is now 
able to dynamically choose ingredients and cookbooks from the pantry and better align 
to the customer’s recipe and preferences. This allows the chef to create a more informed 
and refined dish leveraging both existing and new knowledge. This is retrieval-based 
in-context learning.
• Finally, let’s imagine that we sent our chef back to school to learn a new cuisine or set of 
cuisines (pre-training on a larger dataset of specific examples). This allows the chef to 
approach future unseen customer recipes with deeper understanding. This approach is 
perfect if we want the chef to excel in specific cuisines (knowledge domains). This is fine-
tuning based learning. 
Each of these approaches offers unique advantages and disadvantages in terms of speed, 
cost, and latency. However, by combining these techniques in an agent framework, we can 
leverage the various strengths and minimize their weaknesses, allowing for a more robust and 
adaptable solution.

Agent quick start with LangChain
In order to provide a real-world executable example of an agent in action, we’ll build a quick 
prototype with the LangChain and LangGraph libraries. These popular open source libraries 
allow users to build customer agents by “chaining” together sequences of logic, reasoning, 
and tool calls to answer a user’s query. We’ll use our gemini-1.5-flash-001 model and 
some simple tools to answer a multi-stage query from the user as seen in Snippet 8.
The tools we are using are the SerpAPI (for Google Search) and the Google Places API. After 
executing our program in Snippet 8, you can see the sample output in Snippet 9.

Production applications with Vertex 
AI agents
While this whitepaper explored the core components of agents, building production-grade 
applications requires integrating them with additional tools like user interfaces, evaluation 
frameworks, and continuous improvement mechanisms. Google’s Vertex AI platform 
simplifies this process by offering a fully managed environment with all the fundamental 
elements covered earlier. Using a natural language interface, developers can rapidly 
define crucial elements of their agents - goals, task instructions, tools, sub-agents for task 
delegation, and examples - to easily construct the desired system behavior. In addition, the 
platform comes with a set of development tools that allow for testing, evaluation, measuring 
agent performance, debugging, and improving the overall quality of developed agents. This 
allows developers to focus on building and refining their agents while the complexities of 
infrastructure, deployment and maintenance are managed by the platform itself. 
In Figure 15 we’ve provided a sample architecture of an agent that was built on the Vertex 
AI platform using various features such as Vertex Agent Builder, Vertex Extensions, Vertex 
Function Calling and Vertex Example Store to name a few. The architecture includes many of 
the various components necessary for a production ready application.

Summary
In this whitepaper we’ve discussed the foundational building blocks of Generative AI 
agents, their compositions, and effective ways to implement them in the form of cognitive 
architectures. Some key takeaways from this whitepaper include:
1. Agents extend the capabilities of language models by leveraging tools to access real-
time information, suggest real-world actions, and plan and execute complex tasks 
autonomously. agents can leverage one or more language models to decide when and 
how to transition through states and use external tools to complete any number of 
complex tasks that would be difficult or impossible for the model to complete on its own.
2. At the heart of an agent’s operation is the orchestration layer, a cognitive architecture that 
structures reasoning, planning, decision-making and guides its actions. Various reasoning 
techniques such as ReAct, Chain-of-Thought, and Tree-of-Thoughts, provide a framework 
for the orchestration layer to take in information, perform internal reasoning, and generate 
informed decisions or responses. 
3. Tools, such as Extensions, Functions, and Data Stores, serve as the keys to the outside 
world for agents, allowing them to interact with external systems and access knowledge 
beyond their training data. Extensions provide a bridge between agents and external APIs, 
enabling the execution of API calls and retrieval of real-time information. functions provide 
a more nuanced control for the developer through the division of labor, allowing agents 
to generate Function parameters which can be executed client-side. Data Stores provide 
agents with access to structured or unstructured data, enabling data-driven applications.
The future of agents holds exciting advancements and we’ve only begun to scratch the 
surface of what is possible. As tools become more sophisticated and reasoning capabilities 
are enhanced, agents will be empowered to solve increasingly complex problems. 
Furthermore, the strategic approach of ‘agent chaining’ will continue to gain momentum. By

combining specialized agents - each excelling in a particular domain or task - we can create 
a ‘mixture of agent experts’ approach, capable of delivering exceptional results across 
various industries and problem areas.
It’s important to remember that building complex agent architectures demands an iterative 
approach. Experimentation and refinement are key to finding solutions for specific business 
cases and organizational needs. No two agents are created alike due to the generative nature 
of the foundational models that underpin their architecture. However, by harnessing the 
strengths of each of these foundational components, we can create impactful applications 
that extend the capabilities of language models and drive real-world value.
